# jQuery Superfish Dropdown Menu Plugin with responsive features

Our favourite aquatic superhero returns from his sojourn across the galaxy infused with astonishing, hitherto unseen new powers. In his modern incarnation (wearing a rather spiffy cape) Superfish is dedicated to keeping dropdown/flyout menus accessible across browsers great and small, in addition to adding support for newer touch devices (running Android, iOS, Windows, etc). All this **and** a pretty face.

## Edit Adding responsive feature (look at the screenshots).

## List of new features
* Responsive menu
* Replacing original CSS file by LESS
* Editable toggle button caption
* 2 themes (dark and light)
* Editable breakPoint to switch between mobile and desktop mode
* Enable/Disable mobileMode

## You can even choose an icon
```
  var example = $('#example').superfish({
    toggleBtnCaption: '<i class="ion ion-navicon-round"></i>'
  });
```

## List of editable parameters
* breakPoint: default = 768
* theme: default = "dark",
* enableMobile: default = true,
* toggleBtnCaption: default = 'Open'

## Need help?

Superfish menus have been in use since the dawn of time (well, around 8 years or so) and many are the places where you can find help with your Superfish implementations. [Check out the support options](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/download/#support).
